Project finished for good.

After getting into the directory of TCPchess_v1, launch the server with 'python server.py 2000' and 2 clients with 'python client.py localhost 2000'
This will launch the Chess Game. The Terminal connected earlier will play as white, the later will play as black.
To make a move, type in e2->e4, to promote just follow the instructions you will recieve (i like the Horseys)
The server will display a small GUI as well as a nice text format of the board on the Server terminal.

This works fully correct, but the code isn't very beautiful.

I am looking forward to make a nicer version of it in Java.
